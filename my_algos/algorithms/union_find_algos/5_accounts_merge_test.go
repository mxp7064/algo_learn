ACCOUNTS MERGE â€“ LeetCode 721 (Union-Find)

ðŸ§  PROBLEM:
You're given a list of accounts where each account is a list:
- The first element is the person's name
- The rest are email addresses belonging to that person

Merge accounts that belong to the same person. Two accounts belong to the same person if they share at least one email.
Return the merged accounts â€” name followed by all associated emails (sorted).

âœ… IDENTITY IS BASED ON EMAILS, NOT NAMES!
Even if two names differ (e.g. "John" vs "Jon"), we merge their accounts if they share an email(s).
Account/person name doesn't play any role in the logic.

ðŸ”‘ INSIGHT:
This is a classic use case for Union-Find:
- Each email is a node
- If two emails appear in the same account, we union them
- After processing all accounts, connected components represent the same person

ðŸ§± DATA STRUCTURES:
- UnionFind<string>: Email is used directly as the key (avoids mapping to integer IDs)
- emailToName[email] = name: Tracks the name associated with each email
- rootToEmails[rootEmail] = []emails: Groups all emails by their root

ðŸ“Œ WHY GENERIC UNION-FIND IS BETTER:
- Avoids email <-> ID translation (less code, fewer bugs)
- Emails can be unioned directly
- Cleaner, more readable

ðŸŒ€ DUPLICATES:
- Same email may appear in multiple accounts â€” that's expected
- emailToName just needs to record one mapping per email

ðŸŽ¯ REPRESENTATIVE:
- The root email (from Find) is effectively used as the group ID
- It's not important which email becomes the root â€” we only care that all emails in the group are connected

ðŸ“Š TIME COMPLEXITY:
- O(N * Î±(N)) for Union-Find operations, where N = total number of emails
- O(N log N) to sort email groups

ðŸ“¦ SPACE COMPLEXITY:
- O(N) for maps in Union-Find structure

ðŸ‘€ VISUAL:
Account 1: ["John", "a@mail", "b@mail"]
Account 2: ["John", "b@mail", "c@mail"]
Account 3: ["John", "d@mail"]

UF Connections:

"a"--"b"--"c"         "d"
âŽ¯âŽ¯âŽ¯âŽ¯âŽ¯âŽ¯âŽ¯âŽ¯âŽ¯âŽ¯âŽ¯    âŽ¯âŽ¯âŽ¯âŽ¯âŽ¯âŽ¯âŽ¯âŽ¯
Group 1: [a, b, c]    Group 2: [d]

Merged output: ["John", a, b, c] and ["John", d]
