# 🧠 algo_learn — Mastering Algorithms & Data Structures in Go

This is my **personal deep dive into algorithms and data structures**, implemented in Go, designed for both **mastery** and **interview readiness**.  
The project is based on systematic study, problem-solving, and pattern recognition — with annotated code, categorized modules, and a custom-built pattern cheat sheet.

## 🧩 What's Inside

### 📘 `grokking_algorithms/`
- Exercises & solutions from [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms)
- Reinforced by translating examples into Go

### 🛠 `my_algos/`
- Manually implemented & tested solutions to many algorithm problems
- Categorized by topic (e.g. heap, trie, DP, union-find)
- Designed to be readable, reusable, and well-commented

### 📚 `docs/`
- ✅ [DSA Pattern Decision Guide](docs/dsa_pattern_guide.md): 
  - “When to use what” during problem-solving
  - Used as a quick-access reference for solving new problems
- 🧠 [Graph properties summary](docs/graph_properties.md): 
  - Traversal implications
  - Algorithm compatibility
  - Summary table to help choose the right technique based on graph structure
- 📌 [DSA Cheat Sheet.pdf](docs/DSA%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf)
  - My custom DSA cheat sheet which helps you to quickly refresh your knowledge of many important algorithms
  - Pattern focused with short pseudocode snippets, technique summaries and time/space complexity explanations
