/*
LONGEST COMMON SUBSEQUENCE (LCS) â€“ DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING

Contains variations of the LCS problem which are frequently asked in interviews.

ðŸ§  PROBLEM:
Given two strings, return the length of the longest subsequence present in both of them.
A subsequence is a sequence of characters that appear in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous.

ðŸ“Œ EXAMPLE:
wordA = "fosh"
wordB = "fish"
-> Longest common subsequence: "fsh" (length 3)

ðŸ“Œ ALSO SEE:
See 1_longest_common_substring.go for a simpler related problem â€” that one requires the matching characters to be contiguous,
whereas LCS allows skipping characters as long as order is preserved.

ðŸ§  DP INSIGHT:
We're building a grid where each cell represents the length of the LCS between the first `i` characters of wordA and the first `j` characters of wordB.

If the characters at wordA[i-1] and wordB[j-1] match:
â†’ That means the LCS can be extended, so we set:
    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1

If they don't match:
â†’ We are preserving the best LCS so far by taking the max of:
	- the value above (dp[i-1][j]) â†’ best LCS when skipping current char in wordA
    - the value to the left (dp[i][j-1]) â†’ best LCS when skipping current char in wordB

This means weâ€™re always keeping the best possible LCS so far in the grid, so when a match happens, we can grow from the right base.
